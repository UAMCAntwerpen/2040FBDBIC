# Topic 3 - Pharmacophore searching, docking and virtual screening

In this serie of lessons, the general concepts of docking, virtual screening and pharmacophore searching are explained. Several of these methods are highlighted. In addition, we will show you how to setup the Schrödinger virtual teaching platform so that the theory in these lessons can be applied in practice.


## Prepare yourself:

It is highly recommended that you prepare yourselves by first having a look at the following movies:

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbVB_huh28" target="_blank">What's the difference between structure based and ligand based virtual screening?</a> [YouTube - 2'14"]
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI7ojGoLLUk" target="_blank">What is molecular docking?</a> [YouTube - 5'48"]

Now you should be ready to have a look at these papers:

- <a href="Topic_03/MedChemComm_2017_8_1970.pdf" download>A systematic analysis of atomic protein–ligand interactions in the PDB</a> [pdf]
- <a href="Topic_03/Pharao.pdf" download>Pharao: Pharmacophore alignment and optimization</a> [pdf]
- <a href="Topic_03/Glide.pdf" download>Glide: A New Approach for Rapid, Accurate Docking and Scoring. 1. Method and Assessment of Docking Accuracy</a> [pdf]
- <a href="Topic_03/JMedChem_2008_51_2432.pdf" download>Ligand binding efficiency: trends, physical basis, and implications</a> [pdf]
- <a href="Topic_03/Guide_To_Docking.pdf" download>A practical guide to large-scale docking</a> [pdf]


## Course manual:

- <a href="Topic_03/6-Virtual_screening.pdf" download>Chapter 6: Virtual screening</a> [pdf]


## Slides:

- <a href="Topic_03/Slides_03.pdf" download>Lecture slides of topic 03</a> [pdf]


## Exercises:

To practice the lessons learned, we make use of a <a href="https://teach2023-soc-eu-west2.gcp.tsg.schrodinger.com/workstation/#/" target="_blank">virtual workstation</a> with the software tool Maestro from <a href="https://www.schrodinger.com" target="_blank">Schrödinger</a> already installed. You need an account that will provided to you after inscription to this course.

**Note**

The Virtual Workstation works best on *Google Chrome* or *Safari* browsers.
