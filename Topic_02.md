# Topic 2 - Clustering and machine learning

In this part of the course, you will be introduced to molecular fingerprints and how these are used in similarity searches and clustering algorithms. Following this, you will be introduced to QSAR and learn to build a number of machine learning models in `Google Colab`.

## Prepare yourself:

In order to make full use of this lessons, it is highly recommended to prepare yourselves by first having a look at the following movies:

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK9wHHQfGYA&list=LL&index=1" target="_blank">Machine learning and metrics</a> [YouTube - 24'48"]
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJveOYsK6MY" target="_blank">Supervised and unsupervised learning</a> [YouTube - 2'47"]
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBk8HbjWwCw" target="_blank">Molecular strings and fingerprints</a> [YouTube - 17'25"]


Then have a thorough read of these papers:
