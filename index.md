title:  Chemo-informatics and computational drug design
layout: home
---

This course covers computational drug design and chemo-informatics, which involve using computer simulations and data analysis to discover and develop new medications. You will learn how to model drug-target interactions, screen chemical compound libraries, and predict which molecular candidates show the most therapeutic promise. This course focuses on digital tools and methods that streamline the drug discovery process before compounds move to experimental testing.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

All code and course materials that are used in this course of *Chemo-informatics and computational drug design* at the <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/studeren/aanbod/alle-opleidingen/biochemie-en-biotechnologie/master/studieprogramma/" target="_blank">Master of Biotechnology</a> and <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/pharmaceutical-sciences-programmes/master/drug-development-pharmacist/" target="_blank">Master of Drug Development: Pharmacist</a> at the University of Antwerp can be found in this repository. The course is divided into four main **topics**:

1. [Gathering information about your protein target](01-Topic/index.md)
2. [Working with small molecules in the computer](02-Topic/index.md)
3. [Docking to find needles in the haystack](03-Topic/index.md)
4. [Getting a closer look: molecular mechanics and dynamics](04-Topic/index.md)

# Before you start

A couple of things need to be prepared in order to be ready for this course:

## 1. Install PyMol on your PC or Mac

PyMol is a molecular graphics program that is needed to visualise ligands and protein structures. There are two versions of this program: a commercial one (to be paid for) and an open source version. Installation of the open source version is very straightforward: just download the correct installer and follow the instructions:

- [Download the Windows version - v3.1.0.4](assets/00-Intro/pymol-software-downloads/PyMOL_Open_source_v3.1.0.4+1_WINx64_setup.exe)
- [Download the Mac version - v3.1.0.4](assets/00-Intro/pymol-software-downloads/PyMOL_Open_source_v3.1.0.4+2.dmg)

It could be that more recent versions are available in the meantime. You can always <a href="https://github.com/kullik01/pymol-open-source-setup/releases" target="_blank">visit the official PyMol GitHub download page</a> to check for this.

## 2. Learn or review Python

It is required to have some basic knowledge of the Python programming language. For users that need a refresh, or for those that are not familiar with Python, we have prepared some basic refresher notes in the course material:

- <a href="assets/00-Intro/1-Introduction_to_Python.pdf" download>Chapter 1: Introduction to Python</a> [pdf]

An interesting refresher is available on YouTube:

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8&t=70s" target="_blank">Python for beginners - Learn Python in 1 hour</a> [YouTube - 60'05"]

Finally, you can test your `Python` skills in these Google Colab notebook environments:

- <a href="https://githubtocolab.com/UAMCAntwerpen/2040FBDBIC/blob/master/assets/00-Intro/Basic_Python_Refresher.ipynb" target="_blank">Python refresher code</a> [Google Colab]
- <a href="https://githubtocolab.com/UAMCAntwerpen/2040FBDBIC/blob/master/assets/00-Intro/Basic_Python_Refresher_Exercises.ipynb" target="_blank">Python refresher exercises</a> [Google Colab]

Note: you first have to create a Google account before you can start using Google Colab. You can do this by going to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com" target="_blank">Google Colab</a> and create your account.

## 3. Get a CalcUA account

A CalcUA account is required in order to perform docking and molecular dynamics simulations. If you are inscribed in this course, you will automatically be given a CalcUA user account.

# Finished?

Then it is time to move to the first topic of this course:

- [Topic 1: Gathering information about your protein target](01-Topic/index.md)
