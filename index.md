All code and course materials that are used in the course of <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/studeren/aanbod/alle-opleidingen/biochemie-en-biotechnologie/master/studieprogramma/" target="_blank">Chemo-informatics and computational drug design</a> at the Biochemistry department of the University of Antwerp can be found in this repository. The course is divided into five **topics**:

1. [Representing molecules in the computer](Topic_01.md)
2. [Clustering and machine learning](Topic_02.md)
3. [Molecular docking, virtual screening and pharmacophore searching](Topic_03.md)
4. [Molecular mechanics and dynamics](Topic_04.md)
5. [Artificial intelligence and virtual reality in computational drug design](Topic_05.md)

All topics can be studied in any order, but there are some dependencies so it is recommended to follow the order as shown above.

It is advantage to have some basic knowledge of the Python programming language. For users that need a refresh, or for those that are not familiar with Python, we have prepared some basic refresher notes in the course material:

- <a href="/Intro/1-Introduction_to_Python.pdf" download>Chapter 1: Introduction to Python</a> [pdf]

An interesting refresher is available on YouTube:

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8&t=70s" target="_blank">Python for beginners - Learn Python in 1 hour</a> [YouTube - 60'05"]

Finally, you can test your `Python` skills in these `Google Colab` environments:

- <a href="https://githubtocolab.com/UAMCAntwerpen/2040FBDBIC/blob/master/Intro/Basic_Python_Refresher.ipynb" target="_blank">Python refresher code</a> [Google Colab]
- <a href="https://githubtocolab.com/UAMCAntwerpen/2040FBDBIC/blob/master/Intro/Basic_Python_Refresher_Exercises.ipynb" target="_blank">Python refresher exercises</a> [Google Colab]

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="You first have to create a Google account before you can start using Google Colab." %}

## Finished?

Then it is time to move to the first topic of this course: [Topic 1: Representing molecules in the computer](Topic_01.md).
